        <li>They call me the "Devil Child" and put a bounty of 79 million berries on my head when I was just 8 years old - I was the youngest person to ever receive a bounty.</li>
        <li>I ate the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower-Flower Fruit), which allows me to sprout replicas of my body parts on any surface.
        </li>
        <li>I spent 20 years on the run before joining the Straw Hat Pirates, working with various criminal organizations just to survive.
        </li>
        <li>I have what some call a dark sense of humor. I often make observations that seem to frighten my crewmates.</li>
        <li>I often use my devil fruit powers to create eyes and ears for spying and surveillance.</li>
